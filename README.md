# Human microbiome-derived RiPPs
RiPPs are a class of diverse and widespread natural products produced by a multitude of producers, including bacteria, fungi, and plants. They often exhibit diverse structures, various biological functions, and manifold roles in physiology and ecology, allowing them to mediate the communications between microbes or between microbes and human hosts. In this study, using precursor-centric and PTM-centric approaches, we systematically examined the RiPP biosynthetic potential of 306,481 genomes of the human microbiota to identify 12,076 yet-to-be-discovered RiPP families, largely expanding the chemical landscape of RiPPs. Big data omics analysis reveals that numerous RiPP families are inversely related to various diseases, suggesting their potential protective effects on health.
